Suggested next steps (general guidance):
 - If symptoms are mild, consider self-care (rest, fluids, over-the-counter medications) and monitor your condition.
 - If you suspect COVID-19 (e.g., loss of smell, high fever, cough), consider getting a COVID test and follow local public health guidance.
 - If symptoms are severe (difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain, confusion, inability to wake), seek emergency medical care immediately.
 - For persistent or concerning symptoms, consult a qualified healthcare professional for evaluation and testing.
